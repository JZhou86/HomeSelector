\section*{Motivation}

Buying a house is perhaps the most important purchase people will make in their lives, and one of the most complex. Home buyers must analyze a variety of factors, including house pricing, neighborhood safety, school quality, and the local job market. There are a plethora of data sources one should ideally utilize when making a decision such as purchasing a home, but the sheer amount of varied data available makes it hard to do so. We will create an interface that lets people view all this disparate data in one place by combining Zillow pricing data with neighborhood/county crime rates, board of education standardized testing scores, and so on. The ultimate goal is to have an online interactive map where users can filter zip codes or counties by real estate median price, local crime rate, school quality, etc; the map will also let you overlay crime locations or school test scores.

\section*{Sources Description}

We will use some subset or superset of the following datasets:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Median house price for each zip code/county in the US from Zillow \\ \url{https://www.zillow.com/research/data/}
\item Crime rates for each county in the US from Kaggle \\ \url{https://www.kaggle.com/mikejohnsonjr/united-states-crime-rates-by-county}
\item Crime rates and sex offender lists in various cities across the US \\ \url{https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?tags=crime} 
\item SAT scores by high school - because states handle K-12 education, these datasets have to be taken from each stateâ€™s Department of Education website. We will use a subset of states for the sake of time. Here are the states we will use:
\begin{itemize}
\item CA - \\ \url{https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sp/ai/} (2017)
\item MA - \\ \url{http://profiles.doe.mass.edu/statereport/sat.aspx} (Need to fill in county)
\item FL - \\ \url{http://www.fldoe.org/accountability/accountability-reporting/act-sat-ap-data/} (Need to fill in county)
\item NJ - \\ \url{https://rc.doe.state.nj.us/ReportsDatabase.aspx}
\item VA (old SAT) - \\ \url{http://www.nbc12.com/story/33261679/look-sat-scores-show-wide-gaps-in-central-va-school-districts/}
\item TX - \\ \url{https://tea.texas.gov/acctres/sat_act_index.html} (2017)

\item NY - \\ \url{https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/sat-college-board-2010-school-level-results-5c6d6/resource/7e34dc38-9c9e-43fa-82c3-706f10a93efc?inner_span=True} (Need to obtain county-school data w/ scraper)  
\item IL - \\ \url{https://www.isbe.net/Pages/Illinois-State-Report-Card-Data.aspx}
\item PA - \\ \url{https://www.education.pa.gov/K-12/Assessment\%20and\%20Accountability/Pages/SAT-and-ACT.aspx}
\item GA - \\ \url{http://www.gadoe.org/Curriculum-Instruction-and-Assessment/Curriculum-and-Instruction/Pages/SAT-and-ACT-Results.aspx}
\item NC - \\ \url{http://www.ncpublicschools.org/accountability/reporting/sat/2018}
\end{itemize}

These datasets will be downloaded in CSV form and can be read into the MySQL tables using a command such as: 
\begin{verbatim}
    LOAD DATA INFILE 'c:/tmp/discounts.csv'
    INTO TABLE discounts
    FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
    ENCLOSED BY '"'
    LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
    IGNORE 1 ROWS;
\end{verbatim}
